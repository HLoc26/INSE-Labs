**Answer 1**:

## Step 1: Preparing the environment
### 1.1. Create docker VMs
I have created 2 docker container named lab2-server for the server machine and lab2-client for the client machine:

### 1.2. Install nessesary packages
Then, on both machine, install the nessesary packages:

1. `openssl`: To use openssl
2. `netcat` (traditional): To send and receive files, specifically the public key.
3. `net-tools`: To use the command `ifconfig` to see the IP address of the machine.

Command: `apt update && apt install openssl netcat-traditional net-tools`



 
# Task 2: Encrypting large message 
Create a text file at least 56 bytes.
**Question 1**:
Encrypt the file with aes-256 cipher in CFB and OFB modes. How do you evaluate both cipher as far as error propagation and adjacent plaintext blocks are concerned. 
**Answer 1**:

**Question 2**:
Modify the 8th byte of encrypted file in both modes (this emulates corrupted ciphertext).
Decrypt corrupted file, watch the result and give your comment on Chaining dependencies and Error propagation criteria.

**Answer 2**:
